# Linear-Regression
## Dataset 
The dataset contains 62,000 salaries from top STEM companies and 21 features. The data can be downloaded from the link below:

## Summary findings.
From the Projects1salaries exploration, I found out that most of the people in this industry gave less than 10 years of experience.
I then created a Linera Regression model where you have to input the number of years of experience of a person to get an estimation of how much
they should earn as the base salary.

From exploration of the Salary2 notebook, I concluded from the mean salaries that data scientists earn the highest base salaries. I then created a model where
you have to insert the years of experience, years of working at the company and the job title fro it predict the amount of base salary that a person in those companies 
should earn.
